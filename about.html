                <p class="about-par">My name is Sara Fontana and I am the founder of Sara Michelle Events. I am a twenty-two year old, aspiring event planner from Richmond, Virginia. I am working towards my Bachelors Degree in Mass Communications at Virginia Commonwealth University. I have been passionate about event planning for many years and have finally made the decision to make my dreams into reality! Something I enjoy the most is being able to help people celebrate moments of life, no matter how big or small! Working with me will be a friendly, creative, and hassle-free environment. I look forward to planning your dream day!</p>
