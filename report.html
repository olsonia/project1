        <h1>Bela Olson Project 1 Report</h1>
    </header>

    <p>How I meet the requirements: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I am making this website for my cousin's event planning business, so I am thinking empathetically.</li>
        <li>All the images used in the gallery came from photos she took. I was given permission to use her logo and all photos.</li>
        <li>I do have 5 separate pages for this website.</li>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Contact Page (social media/book consultations to be able to contact her)</li>
                <li>Gallery Page (Images from different events she has done)</li>
                <li>Services Page (services she offers and details about them)</li>
                <li>About page (For people to learn about her and why she created this business)</li>
        <li>I do have a header on each page</li>
        <li>I have a navbar in my header that uses navigation links to access each page</li>
        <li>I have made my website use a distinct layout for anything smaller than 1000px because that is the size that worked the best on my phone. Anything that is in multiple columns shifts to be on one column instead to fit better onto the screen</li>
        <li>I have put all my repeated css for my navigation in its own .css file that is shared between all my files. All other .css files that are not repeated across pages are in separate stylesheets.</li>
        <li>All images used in my website have alt tags so they are readable by screenreaders. I think the tags adequately describe the image content</li>
        <li>Each page has a favicon of a shortened version of her logo with a light pink background</li>
        <li>Non-HTML resources are organized in files according to what they are. I have all images located in an images folder and css files in a CSS folder.</li>
        <li>I do not use any libraries or frameworks in my code, it is all made from CSS and HTML</li>
        <li>All my code validates without warnings or errors on Nu Validator</li>
        <li>I do think my code is neatly aligned. Some things are centered like headers of pages and the footer just because I like the way it looks like that</li>
        <li>All my elements have consistent spacing. No text bleeds against the edges of containing boxes.</li>
        <li>I do use two different font faces. The nav bar is in a serif font while the content of my page is in Century Gothic, which is sans-serif</li>
        <li>I have a form in the contact page, which would use the provided information to send an email</li>
        <li>I use an external link to link to her business instagram.</li>
        <li>I use kebab-case for all classes and ids that I created. It was consistent throughout my code</li>
        <li>My css animation is when you hover over the "book consultation now" button, it changes color from a dark pink to a light pink to grab peoples attention.</li>
        <li>NEED TO SHARE WITH PROF</li>
        <li>All my files are lowercase and do only contain alphanumeric characters.</li>
        <li>Both my http and https resolve to the same site</li>
        <li>My site is served out over HTTPS on port 443. I followed all the steps provided.</li>
        <li>Users do automatically get redirected from port 80 to port 443</li>
        <li>There are a steady flow of commits over the course of when I started the project to the time I finished it</li>
        <li>This is my report (that is also linked in the footer of my webpage) of an itemized breakdown of why I believe I have met the above expectations.</li>
    </ol>
