        <h1>Bela Olson Project 1 Report</h1>
    </header>

    <p>How I meet the requirements: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I am making this website for my cousin's event planning business, so I am thinking empathetically.</li>
        <li>All the images used in the gallery came from photos she took. I was given permission to use her logo and all photos.</li>
        <li>I do have 5 separate pages for this website.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Homepage</li>
                <li>Contact Page (social media/book consultations to be able to contact her)</li>
                <li>Gallery Page (Images from different events she has done)</li>
                <li>Services Page (services she offers and details about them)</li>
                <li>About page (For people to learn about her and why she created this business)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>I do have a header on each page</li>
        <li>I have a navbar in my header that uses navigation links to access each page</li>
        <li>7. I have put all my repeated css for my navigation in its own .css file that is shared between all my files. All other .css files that are not repeated across pages are in separate stylesheets.</li>
        <li>10. Non-HTML resources are organized in files according to what they are. I have all images located in an images folder and css files in a CSS folder.</li>
        <li>21. All my files are lowercase and do only contain alphanumeric characters.</li>
        <li>23. My site is served out over HTTPS on port 443. I followed all the steps provided.</li>
        <li>24. Users do automatically get redirected from port 80 to port 443</li>
    </ol>
