1. What did you like about this website?

I liked the sleek design and consistent style of each of the pages. Each page was well laid out with proper spacing between each element. The form
especially has particularly neat spacing.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.

This P1 site fills up much more of its pages with content. My page includes lots of blank space which is less aesthetically pleasing. Each page on the site
is filled with content and neatly stretches out across the entire page. 

3. Which has a better user experience (and why)?

This project has a better user experience because the elements are larger and more neatly laid out.

4. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

Each of our codebases used similar designs by using div classes to break up each section. However, my setup with div classes is more convuluted, so I think this
project has the more maintainable codebase.

5. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

The code is well structured with neat div classes that are clearly laid out and indented. Each file is clearly named.

6. if not, suggest some specific improvements

7. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

The "Gallery" page's pictures do not appear to be loading correctly because they are sourced locally instead of off the internet. 

8. were semantically appropriate elements selected?

Yes, each element is appropriately chosen for its function. The choices are easy to understand.  

9. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

Yes, an effective stylesheet was utilized that limits duplication.

10. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

The website is beautifully laid out and was easy to navigate. Overall a great project.
